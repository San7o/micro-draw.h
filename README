Features
--------

 - render lines
 - render rectangles
 - render circles
 - render triangles
 - RGBA, easy to add other formats
 - PPM file reading and writing


Usage
-----

Do this:

  #define MICRO_DRAW_IMPLEMENTATION

before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
implementation.

i.e. it should look like this:

  #include ...
  #include ...
  #include ...
  #define MICRO_DRAW_IMPLEMENTATION
  #include "micro-draw.h"

You can tune the library by #defining certain values. See the
"Config" comments under "Configuration" below.

To enable PPM related functions, you need to #define MIRO_DRAW_PPM.
More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm

The usage is quite straight forward, you supply a data buffer to a
micro-draw.h function which will fill the pixels accordingly. For
example, you can use this buffer to render a frame on screen, or to
save it as an image file, or do whatever you want.

Check out some example in the `test` directory.


TODO
----

 - Implement micro_draw_from_ppm
 - Add text rendering
